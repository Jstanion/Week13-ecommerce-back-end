# E-Commerce Back End

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen)

## Description

I built this application to familiarize myself with teh relationships between databases and server-side Api's. I also wanted to strenghten my skillset with an e-commerce design, as it is a fast growing market in today's business industry.  E-commerce is one of the top growing fields in the tech job market, so creating a successful platform to run a virtual business would be appealing to recruiters. This application allows a business owner to store catalogue data for purchase. The data is sorted into ctagories and can be grouped by tag definitions. It will need a UI platform to connect consumers to the data but this code can be easily adapted to any front end buildout. Using MySQL and sequalize has helped me understand Object Relational Mapping and how the data speaks to one another.
